# Andee for Arduino Nano 33 BLE
## Andee Library for Arduino Nano 33 BLE and Arduino Nano 33 BLE SENSE Boards
This library allow users to use the Andee app on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE and Arduino Nano 33 BLE SENSE boards. All you need is the board, the Arduino IDE and your phone with the Andee app installed to get a UI up and running.

## Installation
1. Make sure that your Arduino IDE can recognise your Arduino Nano 33 BLE board. If you have done this, go to step 2. If not, in the Arduino IDE, go to File -> Board -> Boards Manager. Search for "Arduino nRF528x Boards" without the open inverted commas. Then press the Install button and wait for the installation to finish.

2. Next you will need to install the ArduinoBLE library. In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries. Search for ArduinoBLE and install the latest version.

3. Lastly you will need the Andee for Nano library. You can download the library by going to the library manager again and search for Andee for nano. Install the latest version and you should be ready.

You can also choose to download the library from our github page at https://github.com/Annikken/Andee_for_Nano33BLE. Click the green download button and click on Download Zip. Unzip the file to your Arduino library folder, which by default is located at C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\Arduino.
